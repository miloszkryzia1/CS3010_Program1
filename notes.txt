- retrieve matrix from input
- retrieve b values
- output matrix
- go through each row up to [i][j-1]
- choose max element, add to scale factor array
- compute scale rations and add to scale ratio array
- choose max scale ratio, then choose pivot row based on index
- compute multipliers, add to multipliers array
- multiply pivot coeffs and store
- subtract new pivot coeffs from each row coeffs in matrix
- output new matrix
- keep track of 'l' array
- repeat until done


- compute solution using values in final matrix and l array
- output solution
